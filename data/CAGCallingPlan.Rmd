1. Select the alleles and determine CAGs"), e.g. nearest peak (Riccardo), linear model or from BP size (need to correct).
2. Try to keep it somewhat modular, could have a drop down box w/ different algorithms/models for getting peaks in future

Ideas:
- allow selection of plot type. Add the option of bars instead of points/lines
