<p>This step identifies the ladders in the ladder channel which is used
to call the base pair size.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The ladder peaks are assigned from largest to smallest using the
supplied ladder sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>Base pair sizes are assigned using the local Southern method.
Basically, for each data point, linear models are made for the lower and
upper 3 size standard and the predicted sizes are averaged. This means
that it may not matter if the ladder is miss-assigned far away from you
data signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Each ladder should be manually inspected to make sure that is has
been correctly assigned.</p></li>
</ul>
