This step identifies the ladders in the ladder channel which is used to call the base pair size.

-   The ladder peaks are assigned from largest to smallest using the supplied ladder sizes.

-   Base pair sizes are assigned using the local Southern method. Basically, for each data point, linear models are made for the lower and upper 3 size standard and the predicted sizes are averaged. This means that it may not matter if the ladder is miss-assigned far away from you data signal.

-   Each ladder should be manually inspected to make sure that is has been correctly assigned.
