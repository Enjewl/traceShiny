<h3>Ladder Sizes</h3>
<p>numeric vector: base pair sizes of ladder used in fragment
analysis.</p>

<div id="input-ladder-starting-scan-position" class="section level3">
<h3>Input Ladder Starting Scan Position</h3>
<p>numeric: indicate the scan number to start looking for ladder peaks.
Usually this can be automatically found (when set to NULL) since thereâ€™s
a big spike right at the start. However, if your ladder peaks are taller
than the big spike, you will need to set this starting scan number
manually.</p>

<div id="minimum-peak-signal" class="section level3">
<h3>Minimum Peak Signal</h3>
<p>Minimum height of peak from smoothed signal. Note that the smoothing
applied to the signal lowers the value, so you need to select a value
lower than what you see on the plot.</p>
</div>
<div id="apply-zero-floor" class="section level3">
<h3>Apply Zero Floor</h3>
<p>If set to TRUE, all negative values will be set to zero. This can
help deal with cases where there are peaks in the negative direction
that interfere with peak detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="scan-subset" class="section level3">
<h3>Scan Subset</h3>
<p>Filter the ladder and data signal between the selected scans (eg
scan_subset = c(3000, 5000)).</p>
</div>
<div id="ladder-selection-window" class="section level3">
<h3>Ladder Selection Window</h3>
<p>In the ladder assigning algorithm, the we iterate through the scans
in blocks and test their linear fit ( We can assume that the ladder is
linear over a short distance) This value defines how large that block of
peaks should be.</p>
</div>
<div id="max-combinations" class="section level3">
<h3>Max Combinations</h3>
<p>What is the maximum number of ladder combinations that should be
tested.</p>
</div>
<div id="smoothing-window" class="section level3">
<h3>Smoothing Window</h3>
<p>numeric: ladder signal smoothing window size passed</p>
