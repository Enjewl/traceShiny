1. Point to a folder w/ FSAs
2. Upload manifest w/ meta data etc.
3. For gene mapper output, have a selectable box.
4. Think about ladder -- either needs to be a manual box OR could be part of the manifest? Could have a ladder id on the manifest, which you fill in on the app. Have an option for mouse vs human vs cell?



Need to think about what happens if someone selects the wrong box and for example puts the peak table in the FSA file box
