<h2>Tandem Repeat Analysis by Capillary Electrophoresis (TRACE)</h2>
<p>This web server is designed to help guide users through a pipeline
for short tandem repeat instability analysis from fragment analysis
data. The inputs are fsa files or peak tables (eg Genemapper software
output), and a user supplied metadata data-frame. This is an app version
of our R package trace, that has the following key features with
additional interactivity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Processing fsa files (ladder identification, base pair
assignment, peak identification).</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying alleles and calling repeats.</p></li>
<li><p>Assigning index peaks and calculating instability metrics
(e.g. expansion index or average repeat gain)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Important experimental considerations</h3>
<p>There are several important factors to a successful repeat
instability experiment and things to consider when using this
package:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(required) Each sample has a unique id, usually the file
name</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Baseline control for your experiment. For example,
specifying a sample where the modal allele is the inherited repeat
length (eg a mouse tail sample) or a sample at the start of a
time-course experiment. This is indicated with a <code>TRUE</code> in
the <code>metrics_baseline_control</code> column of the metadata.
Samples are then grouped together with the <code>metrics_group_id</code>
column of the metadata. Multiple samples can be
<code>metrics_baseline_control</code>, which can be helpful for the
average repeat gain metric to have a more accurate representation of the
average repeat at the start of the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Batch or repeat length correction for systematic batch
effects that occur with repeat-containing amplicons in capillary
electrophoresis.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Repeat containing amplicons do not run linearly with internal
ladder sizes in capillary electrophoresis resulting is an
underestimation of repeat length if you just convert from base-pair
size. These differences are not always consistent across runs which can
result in batch effects in the repeat size. So, if the repeat length is
to be directly compared for samples from different runs, this batch
effect needs to be corrected. This is only relevant when the absolute
size of a amplicons are compared for grouping metrics as described above
(otherwise instability metrics are all relative and it doesn’t matter
that there’s systematic batch effects across runs), when plotting traces
from different runs, or if an accurate repeat length is
desired.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two main correction approaches that are somewhat
related: either ‘batch’ or ‘repeat’ in <code>call_repeats()</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Batch correction is relatively simple and just requires you to
link samples across batches by indicating them from metadata. But even
though the repeat size that is return will be precise, it will not be
accurate and underestimates the real repeat length.</p></li>
<li><p>By contrast, repeat correction can be used to accurately call
repeat lengths (which also corrects the batch effects). However, the
repeat correction will only be as good as your sample(s) used to call
the repeat length. With how repeat correction works in this app, it’s
helpful to i) use the same samples across multiple runs (visualizations
help you check that correction is consistent across runs), and ii) using
multiple samples for correction for each run (helpful to help validate
that each sample was called correctly).</p></li>
