<p>Metadata can be incorporated to allow additional functionality in
repeat calling (correcting batch effects across fragment analysis runs)
and index peak assignment (assigning index peak from another
sample).</p>
<p>There are several important factors to a successful repeat
instability experiment and things to consider when using this tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(required) Each sample has a unique id, usually the file
name</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Baseline control for your experiment. For example,
specifying a sample where the modal allele is the inherited repeat
length (eg a mouse tail sample) or a sample at the start of a
time-course experiment. This is indicated with a <code>TRUE</code> in
the <code>metrics_baseline_control</code> column of the metadata.
Samples are then grouped together with the <code>metrics_group_id</code>
column of the metadata. Multiple samples can be
<code>metrics_baseline_control</code>, which can be helpful for the
average repeat gain metric to have a more accurate representation of the
average repeat at the start of the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Using common sample(s) across fragment analysis runs
to correct systematic batch effects that occur with repeat-containing
amplicons in capillary electrophoresis. There are slight fluctuations of
size across runs for amplicons containing repeats that result in
systematic differences around 1-3 base pairs. So, if samples are to be
analyzed for different runs, the absolute bp size is not comparable
unless this batch effect is corrected. This is only relevant when the
absolute size of a amplicons are compared for grouping metrics as
described above (otherwise instability metrics are all relative and it
doesn’t matter that there’s systematic batch effects across runs) or
when plotting traces from different runs. This correction can be
achieved by running a couple of samples in every fragment analysis run,
or having a single run that takes a couple of samples from every run
together, thereby linking them. These samples are then indicated in the
metadata with <code>batch_run_id</code> (to group samples by fragment
analysis run) and <code>batch_sample_id</code> (to enable linking
samples across batches).</p></li>

<p>Prepare a file (eg spreadsheet saved as .csv) with the following
columns. Use the specified column names below:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="29%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="45%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Metadata table column</th>
<th>Functionality metadata is associated with</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>unique_id</td>
<td>Required for adding metadata</td>
<td>The unique identifier for the fsa file. Usually the sample file
name. This must be unique, including across runs.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>metrics_group_id</td>
<td><code>assign_index_peaks</code>, allows grouping samples</td>
<td>This groups the samples for instability metric calculations. Provide
a group id value for each sample. For example, in a mouse experiment and
using the expansion index, you need to group the samples since they have
the same metrics baseline control (eg inherited repeat length), so
provide the mouse id.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>metrics_baseline_control</td>
<td><code>assign_index_peaks</code>, allows grouping samples</td>
<td>This is related to metrics_group_id. Indicate with ‘TRUE’ to specify
which sample is the baseline control (eg mouse tail for inherited repeat
length, or day-zero sample in cell line experiments)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>batch_run_id</td>
<td><code>call_repeats</code>, allows setting
<code>batch_correction</code></td>
<td>This groups the samples by batch. Provide a value for each fragment
analysis run (eg date).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>batch_sample_id</td>
<td><code>call_repeats</code>, allows setting
<code>batch_correction</code></td>
<td>This groups the samples across batches. Give a unique sample id to
each different sample.</td>
