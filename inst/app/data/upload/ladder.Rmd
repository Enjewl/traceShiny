To use the default ladders included in the package, simply keep the 'use default ladders' option ticked.

To create a custom ladder file, you will want to have .csv file with a header and two columns. Column 1 is the ladder ID (which can be anything). Column 2 is the expected bp peaks, which should be separated by commas, i.e.: 15,25,50,60 etc.

```{r, include=FALSE}
#TOODO
#change how custom ladder input works


```
