## Introduction

Welcome to **CAG checkout** (name pending), a shiny interface for the analysis of genomic repeat data obtained from fragment analysis (e.g. genescan). If you prefer, you can also run the functions independently of shiny. The functions for detecting peaks from genescan data may have broader applicability, although we cannot guarantee its usefulness in this context. You can learn more about the package our github page at <http://thisisnotaurl.com>.


```{r cars}
install.packages('blah blah')
