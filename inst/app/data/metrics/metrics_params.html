<div id="grouped-index-assignment" class="section level3">
<h3>Grouped index assignment</h3>
<p>A key part of instability metrics is the index peak. This is the
repeat length used as the reference peak for relative instability
metrics calculations, like expansion index. This is usually the the
inherited repeat length of a mouse, or the modal repeat length for the
cell line at a starting time point.</p>
<p>If grpuped index assignment is set, this function groups the samples
by their <code>metrics_group_id</code> and uses the samples set as
<code>metrics_baseline_control</code> to set the index peak. This is
useful for cases like inferring repeat size of inherited alleles from
mouse tail data. If the samples that are going to be used to assign
index peak are from different fragment analysis runs, use batch or
repeat correction to make sure the systematic differences between runs
are corrected and the correct index peak is assigned. If there are
multiple samples used as baseline control, the median value will be used
to assign index peak to corresponding samples.</p>
<p>If grouped index assignment is not set, the modal peak will be used
as the index peak.</p>

<div id="peak-threshold" class="section level3">
<h3>peak threshold</h3>
<p>The threshold for peak heights to be considered in the calculations,
relative to the modal peak height of the expanded allele.</p>
</div>
<div id="window-around-index-peak" class="section level3">
<h3>window around index peak</h3>
<p>A numeric vector (length = 2) defining the range around the index
peak. First number specifies repeats before the index peak, second
after. For example, c(-5, 40) around an index peak of 100 would analyze
repeats 95 to 140. The sign of the numbers does not matter (The absolute
value is found).</p>
</div>
<div id="advanced-percentile-range" class="section level3">
<h3>(advanced) percentile range</h3>
<p>Generate a number sequence for computation of repeat
expansion_percentile_*. e.g. from 0.5 to 0.95 by interval 0.05 enables
computation of percentiles 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90
0.95.</p>
</div>
<div id="advanced-repeat-range" class="section level3">
<h3>(advanced) repeat range</h3>
<p>A numeric vector specifying ranges of repeats for
expansion_percentile_for_repeat_* computation. e.g. from 0.5 to 0.95 by
interval 0.05 enables computation of percentiles 0 5 10 15 20.</p>
