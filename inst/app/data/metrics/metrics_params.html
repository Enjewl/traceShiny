<h3>peak threshold</h3>
<p>The threshold for peak heights to be considered in the calculations,
relative to the modal peak height of the expanded allele.</p>
</div>
<div id="window-around-index-peak" class="section level3">
<h3>window around index peak</h3>
<p>A numeric vector (length = 2) defining the range around the index
peak. First number specifies repeats before the index peak, second
after. For example, c(-5, 40) around an index peak of 100 would analyze
repeats 95 to 140. The sign of the numbers does not matter (The absolute
value is found).</p>

<div id="percentile-range" class="section level3">
<h3>percentile range</h3>
<p>A numeric vector of percentiles to compute (e.g., c(0.5, 0.75, 0.9,
0.95)).</p>
</div>
<div id="repeat-range" class="section level3">
<h3>repeat range</h3>
<p>A numeric vector specifying ranges of repeats for the inverse
quantile computation.</p>
