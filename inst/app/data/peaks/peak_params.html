<h2>Find fragments</h2>

<div id="find-alleles" class="section level2">
<h2>Find Alleles</h2>
<p>This function finds the main alleles for each fragment by identifying
clusters of peaks (“peak regions”) with the highest signal intensities.
This is based on the idea that PCR amplicons of repeats have clusters of
peaks (from somatic mosaicism and PCR artifacts) that help differentiate
the main allele of interest from capillary electrophoresis
noise/contamination.</p>
<p>The tallest of peaks will be selected as the allele. This means that
if your sample has multiple alleles, you’ll need to make sure that your
data is subsetted to exclude that second allele. For example in a human
cell line with a shorter repeat, we recommend using min bp size in find
fragments to make sure that the smaller allele is excluded. Otherwise,
the smaller taller allele will be set as the allele.</p>
<p>The parameters peak region height threshold multiplier and peak
region size gap threshold will only need to be adjusted if peaks are not
being found for some reason. They influence the criteria for identifying
peak regions, and finding the right balance between them is crucial.</p>
<div id="advanced-peak-region-size-gap-threshold" class="section level3">
<h3>(advanced) peak region size gap threshold</h3>
<p>Gap threshold for identifying peak regions. The peak region size gap
threshold is a parameter used to determine the maximum allowed gap
between peak sizes within a peak region. Adjusting this parameter
affects the size range of peaks that can be grouped together in a
region. A smaller value makes it more stringent, while a larger value
groups peaks with greater size differences, leading to broader peak
regions that may encompass wider size ranges.</p>
</div>
<div id="advanced-peak-region-height-threshold-multiplier" class="section level3">
<h3>(advanced) peak region height threshold multiplier</h3>
<p>Multiplier for the peak height threshold. The peak region height
threshold multiplier parameter allows adjusting the threshold for
identifying peak regions based on peak heights. Increasing this
multiplier value will result in higher thresholds, making it more
stringent to consider peaks as part of a peak region. Conversely,
reducing the multiplier value will make the criteria less strict,
potentially leading to more peaks being grouped into peak regions. It’s
important to note that this parameter’s optimal value depends on the
characteristics of the data and the specific analysis goals. Choosing an
appropriate value for this parameter can help in accurately identifying
meaningful peak regions in the data.</p>

<div id="call-repeats" class="section level2">
<h2>Call Repeats</h2>
<p>This function has a lot of different options features for determining
the repeat length of your samples. This includes i) an option to force
the peaks to be whole repeat units apart, ii) corrections of batch
effects or accurately calling repeat length by comparing to samples of
known length, and iii) forcing repeat pattern by re-calling the peaks to
remove any contaminating peaks or shoulder-peaks.</p>
<div id="assay-size-without-repeat" class="section level3">
<h3>Assay Size Without Repeat</h3>
<p>An integer specifying the assay size without repeat for repeat
calling. This is the length of the sequence flanking the repeat in the
PCR product.</p>
</div>
<div id="repeat-size" class="section level3">
<h3>Repeat Size</h3>
<p>An integer specifying the repeat size for repeat calling.</p>
</div>
<div id="correction" class="section level3">
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>There are two main correction approaches that are somewhat related:
either ‘batch’ or ‘repeat’. Batch correction is relatively simple and
just requires you to link samples across batches to correct batch-batch
variation in repeat sizes. However, even though the repeat size that is
return will be precise, it will not be accurate and underestimates the
real repeat length. By contrast, repeat correction can be used to
accurately call repeat lengths (which also corrects the batch
effects).</p>
<p>Batch correction uses common sample(s) across fragment analysis runs
to correct systematic batch effects that occur with repeat-containing
amplicons in capillary electrophoresis. There are slight fluctuations of
size across runs for amplicons containing repeats that result in
systematic differences around 1-3 base pairs. So, if samples are to be
analyzed for different runs, the absolute bp size is not comparable
unless this batch effect is corrected. This is only relevant when the
absolute size of a amplicons are compared for grouping metrics as
described above (otherwise instability metrics are all relative and it
doesn’t matter that there’s systematic batch effects across runs) or
when plotting traces from different runs. This correction can be
achieved by running a couple of samples in every fragment analysis run,
or having a single run that takes a couple of samples from every run
together, thereby linking them. These samples are then indicated in the
metadata with batch_run_id (to group samples by fragment analysis run)
and batch_sample_id (to enable linking samples across batches).</p>
<p>Samples with known and validated repeat size can be used to
accurately call the repeat length (and therefore also correct batch
effects). Similar to batch correction, batch_run_id (to group samples by
fragment analysis run) and batch_sample_id (to enable linking samples
across batches) are used, but importantly batch_sample_modal_repeat is
also set. The batch_sample_modal_repeat is the validated repeat length
of the modal repeat of the sample. This validated repeat length is then
used to call the repeat length of the modal repeat for each sample (by
each batch_run_id). You can then visualize the batch_sample_id across
runs and the model generated for each run to determine if the repeat
correction has worked as expected.</p>

<div id="force-whole-repeat-units" class="section level3">
<h3>Force Whole Repeat Units</h3>
<p>The <code>force_whole_repeat_units</code> option aims to correct for
the systematic underestimation in fragment sizes that occurs in
capillary electrophoresis. It is independent to the algorithms described
above and can be used in conjunction. It modifies repeat lengths in a
way that helps align peaks with the underlying repeat pattern, making
the repeat lengths whole units (rather than ~0.9 repeats). The
calculated repeat lengths start from the main peak’s repeat length and
increases in increments of the specified <code>repeat_size</code> in
either direction. This option basically enables you to get exactly the
same result as expansion_index values calculated from data from
Genemapper.</p>
</div>
<div id="force-repeat-pattern-size-peroid" class="section level3">
<h3>force repeat pattern size peroid</h3>
<p>This parameter re-calls the peaks based on specified
(<code>force_repeat_pattern_size_period</code>) periodicity of the
peaks. The main application of this algorithm is to solve the issue of
contaminating peaks in the expected regular pattern of peaks. We can use
the periodicity to jump between peaks and crack open a window
(<code>force_repeat_pattern_scan_window</code>) to then pick out the
tallest scan in the window.</p>
</div>
<div id="advanced-force_repeat_pattern_size_period" class="section level3">
<h3>(advanced) force_repeat_pattern_size_period</h3>
<p>A numeric value to set the peak periodicity bp size. In fragment
analysis, the peaks are usually slightly below the actual repeat unit
size, so you can use this value to fine tune what the periodicity should
be.</p>
</div>
<div id="advanced-force_repeat_pattern_scan_window" class="section level3">
<h3>(advanced) force_repeat_pattern_scan_window</h3>
<p>A numeric value for the scan window when assigning the peak. When the
scan period is determined, the algorithm jumps to the predicted scan for
the next peak. This value opens a window of the neighboring scans to
pick the tallest in.</p>
