<h2>How to upload data</h2>
<p>Select the data to upload. There are three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the &ldquo;Data upload type&rdquo; (see table below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the file(s) to upload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to the right-hand side of the screen and made sure that the uploaded data has been correctly parsed. See below for descriptions of each of the fields.</p>

<p>What is the original source of of the peak table. For example, &ldquo;genemapper5&rdquo; means that the data was processed in genemapper and the called peaks were exported. Within the app, there are functions for tidying up the genemapper data, so it&rsquo;s important that it is the raw output.</p>
<p>&ldquo;generic&rdquo; is the most basic format possible where there are only three elements: i) unique sample id, ii) peak base pair size, iii) peak height. It must only be from the channel containing the data.</p>
