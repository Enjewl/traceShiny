<h2>Tandem Repeat Analysis by Capillary Electrophoresis</h2>
<p>This web server is designed to help guide users through a pipeline
for short tandem repeat instability analysis from fragment analysis
data. The inputs are fsa files or peak tables (eg Genemapper software
output), and a user supplied metadata data-frame. This is an app version
of our R package <a href="https://zachariahmclean.github.io/trace/">trace</a>, that has the
following key features with additional interactivity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Processing fsa files (ladder identification, base pair
assignment, peak identification).</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying alleles and calling repeats.</p></li>
<li><p>Assigning index peaks and calculating instability metrics
(e.g. expansion index or average repeat gain)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Important experimental considerations</h2>
<p>There are several important factors to a successful repeat
instability experiment and things to consider when using this tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(required) Each sample has a unique id, usually the file
name</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Baseline control for your experiment. For example,
specifying a sample where the modal allele is the inherited repeat
length (eg a mouse tail sample) or a sample at the start of a
time-course experiment. This is indicated with a <code>TRUE</code> in
the <code>metrics_baseline_control</code> column of the metadata.
Samples are then grouped together with the <code>metrics_group_id</code>
column of the metadata. Multiple samples can be
<code>metrics_baseline_control</code>, which can be helpful for the
average repeat gain metric to have a more accurate representation of the
average repeat at the start of the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Using common sample(s) across fragment analysis runs
to correct systematic batch effects that occur with repeat-containing
amplicons in capillary electrophoresis. There are slight fluctuations of
size across runs for amplicons containing repeats that result in
systematic differences around 1-3 base pairs. So, if samples are to be
analyzed for different runs, the absolute bp size is not comparable
unless this batch effect is corrected. This is only relevant when the
absolute size of a amplicons are compared for grouping metrics as
described above (otherwise instability metrics are all relative and it
doesn’t matter that there’s systematic batch effects across runs) or
when plotting traces from different runs. This correction can be
achieved by running a couple of samples in every fragment analysis run,
or having a single run that takes a couple of samples from every run
together, thereby linking them. These samples are then indicated in the
metadata with <code>batch_run_id</code> (to group samples by fragment
analysis run) and <code>batch_sample_id</code> (to enable linking
samples across batches).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not intended to be a genotyping tool in its current form.
While the repeat lengths generated are precise, they are not accurate.
We directly convert base pair size to repeat length, which
underestimates the repeat length in fragment analysis data. However,
this does not matter for instability metrics which are relative
measures.</p>
